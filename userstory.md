## Implement System Control User for Each Server

**As a** system administrator, **I want** to create a dedicated user for managing system controls on each server, **So that** I can maintain a secure and organized environment for managing server operations.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   Create a dedicated user account for system control management on each server.
-   Assign the necessary permissions to the user for controlling system services.
-   Ensure that the user account can only access and manage system controls.
-   Verify that other non-admin users cannot access or modify system controls.
-   Document the process for creating and managing this user account.

## Develop a Script to Disable Firewalls

**As a** network administrator, **I want** to create a script that can shut off firewalls on specified servers, **So that** I can quickly disable firewall protection when needed for maintenance or troubleshooting.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   Develop a script that can disable the firewalls on specified servers.
-   The script should accept a list of target servers as input.
-   Ensure the script verifies user permissions before executing the action.
-   Log the execution of the script for auditing purposes.
-   Test the script on various server configurations to ensure compatibility and effectiveness.

## Package Listeners and Frontends for Reusability

**As a** software developer, **I want** to create packages out of each listener and frontend component, **So that** I can reuse and deploy them more easily in different applications.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   Identify and separate listeners and frontend components from existing applications.
-   Create modular and reusable packages for each listener and frontend component.
-   Ensure that packages are well-documented and include configuration instructions.
-   Test packages for compatibility and interoperability with various applications.
-   Store packages in a central repository for easy access and deployment.

## Implement a Version Control System for Tracking Changes

**As a** development team, **We want** to implement a version control system to track changes made to our codebase, **So that** we can maintain an organized workflow, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions when necessary.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   create our own version control system.
-   track changes to packages similar to git status.
-   we have to keep track of any files that are modifed and keep a list in ini files.




## Create Listener for Zipping and Unzipping Changelog on QA, Dev, and Prod Clusters

**As a** development team, **We want** to create a listener on QA, Dev, and Prod clusters that zips and unzips changes to a changelog, **So that** we can efficiently manage and track changes to our codebase across different environments.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   Design and implement a listener that can be deployed on QA, Dev, and Prod clusters.
-   The listener should monitor changes to the codebase in each environment.
-   The listener should automatically zip changes and store them in a designated location.
-   When changes are deployed to a new environment, the listener should unzip the changes and apply them to the target cluster.
-   The changelog should be stored in an INI file format for easy parsing and readability.
-   Implement a notification system to alert relevant team members when changes are zipped, unzipped, or applied to a new environment.
-   Test the listener across QA, Dev, and Prod clusters to ensure it functions as expected and does not impact performance or stability.
-   Document the listener's functionality, configuration, and deployment process.
