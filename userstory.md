## Implement System Control User for Each Server

**As a** system administrator, **I want** to create a dedicated user for managing system controls on each server, **So that** I can maintain a secure and organized environment for managing server operations.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   Create a dedicated user account for system control management on each server.
-   Assign the necessary permissions to the user for controlling system services.
-   Ensure that the user account can only access and manage system controls.
-   Verify that other non-admin users cannot access or modify system controls.
-   Document the process for creating and managing this user account.

## Develop a Script to Disable Firewalls

**As a** network administrator, **I want** to create a script that can shut off firewalls on specified servers, **So that** I can quickly disable firewall protection when needed for maintenance or troubleshooting.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   Develop a script that can disable the firewalls on specified servers.
-   The script should accept a list of target servers as input.
-   Ensure the script verifies user permissions before executing the action.
-   Log the execution of the script for auditing purposes.
-   Test the script on various server configurations to ensure compatibility and effectiveness.

## Package Listeners and Frontends for Reusability

**As a** software developer, **I want** to create packages out of each listener and frontend component, **So that** I can reuse and deploy them more easily in different applications.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   Identify and separate listeners and frontend components from existing applications.
-   Create modular and reusable packages for each listener and frontend component.
-   Ensure that packages are well-documented and include configuration instructions.
-   Test packages for compatibility and interoperability with various applications.
-   Store packages in a central repository for easy access and deployment.

## Implement a Version Control System for Tracking Changes

**As a** development team, **We want** to implement a version control system to track changes made to our codebase, **So that** we can maintain an organized workflow, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions when necessary.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   create our own version control system.
-   track changes to packages similar to git status.
-   we have to keep track of any files that are modifed and keep a list in ini files.




## Create Listener for Zipping and Unzipping Changelog on QA, Dev, and Prod Clusters

**As a** development team, **We want** to create a listener on QA, Dev, and Prod clusters that zips and unzips changes to a changelog, **So that** we can efficiently manage and track changes to our codebase across different environments.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   Design and implement a listener that can be deployed on QA, Dev, and Prod clusters.
-   The listener should monitor changes to the codebase in each environment.
-   The listener should automatically zip changes and store them in a designated location.
-   When changes are deployed to a new environment, the listener should unzip the changes and apply them to the target cluster.
-   The changelog should be stored in an INI file format for easy parsing and readability.
-   Implement a notification system to alert relevant team members when changes are zipped, unzipped, or applied to a new environment.
-   Test the listener across QA, Dev, and Prod clusters to ensure it functions as expected and does not impact performance or stability.
-   Document the listener's functionality, configuration, and deployment process.

## Create RabbitMQ Clusters for Dev, Prod, and QA Environments Controlled by Deployment Server

**As a** development team, **We want** to create RabbitMQ clusters for Dev, Prod, and QA environments that are controlled by a deployment server, **So that** we can efficiently manage message queues and communication across different environments.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   Set up and configure RabbitMQ clusters for Dev, Prod, and QA environments.
-   Ensure that each RabbitMQ cluster is properly tuned and optimized for its respective environment.
-   Establish a connection between the deployment server and RabbitMQ clusters, allowing the deployment server to manage and control each cluster.
-   Implement security measures to ensure that only the deployment server and authorized users have access to the RabbitMQ clusters.
-   Create guidelines and procedures for managing and maintaining the RabbitMQ clusters across environments.
-   Set up monitoring and alerting systems to track the performance and health of each RabbitMQ cluster.
-   Test the RabbitMQ clusters and their integration with the deployment server to ensure seamless communication and management.
-   Document the setup, configuration, and management process for the RabbitMQ clusters in each environment.
# Epic: Deployment Server for Managing QA, Prod, and Dev Clusters

**Objective**: Create a deployment server that can access each node of the QA, Prod, and Dev clusters, maintain a database for tracking different versions, and automate changes to files, in order to efficiently manage deployment, monitor changes, and maintain communication between environments.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Set Up and Configure Deployment Server

**As a** development team, **We want** to set up and configure a deployment server with the necessary hardware and software resources, **So that** we have a robust platform for managing deployments and monitoring changes across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

-   Identify hardware and software requirements for the deployment server.
-   Set up the deployment server with required resources.
-   Configure the deployment server according to project requirements.
-   Test the deployment server to ensure it meets performance and stability requirements.

### User Story 2: Establish Access and Connection to Clusters

**As a** development team, **We want** the deployment server to have access to each node of the QA, Prod, and Dev clusters, **So that** we can manage deployments and monitor changes across environments efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

-   Configure the deployment server to have access to each node of the QA, Prod, and Dev clusters.
-   Establish secure and efficient connections between the deployment server and the clusters.
-   Test the connections to ensure seamless communication and data transfer between the deployment server and the clusters.

### User Story 3: Implement Version Tracking Database

**As a** development team, **We want** to implement a database on the deployment server to keep track of the different versions of QA, Dev, and Prod environments, **So that** we can maintain an organized record of deployments and changes across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

-   Design the database schema for tracking different versions of QA, Dev, and Prod environments.
-   Implement the database on the deployment server.
-   Test the database for data integrity, reliability, and performance.
